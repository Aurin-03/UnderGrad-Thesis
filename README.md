## Project Title
Enhancing Heatwave Predictability in Bangladesh through Deep Learning Approaches


## About

### Idea and Inspiration
Heat Waves cause billions of dollars worth of damage and thousands of fatalities every year across the globe. Heatwaves are hitting both developed and developing countries worldwide, and they are not just happening in certain places. They are happening more and more frequently. The terrible effects of the 2022 heatwave, which broke records both in Bangladesh and globally, highlighted how urgently this problem needs to be addressed. Excessive temperature has created great havoc in Bangladesh in recent years. 


## Approach

### About:
The purpose of this study is to examine several deep learning models to determine their predictability and enhance prediction accuracy to aid disaster preparedness and community resilience against extreme heat events in Bangladesh.

### DataSet: 
The dataset used in this research is a private dataset that has been collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department(BMD). We have used the historical weather data
of Bangladesh from 1996 to 2020. The data has been previously used in several studies related to weather.

### Model:
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Convolutional 1D (Conv1D)
* Hybrid Models(Conv1D+LSTM, Conv1D+GRU)

### Materials Used:
* Language: Python
* IDE: Colab
